# Bangla Lang - Interpreted Programming Language in Bangla Script

**Bangla Lang** is an interpreted programming language that allows developers to write code using the Bangla script. It’s designed to make programming more accessible for Bengali speakers by using their native language for syntax. Developed using C#, this project bridges the gap between technology and language, providing an innovative tool for native Bengali-speaking developers.

## Features

- **Bangla Script Syntax**: Write code entirely in Bangla script for an intuitive experience.
- **Interpreted Language**: Executes code line by line, providing real-time feedback.
- **C# Backend**: Built using C# for efficient performance and cross-platform compatibility.
- **User-Friendly**: Ideal for beginners and Bengali-speaking programmers.

## Prerequisites

To run **Bangla Lang**, you will need:

- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or higher)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayemahamed/BanglaProgrammingLanguage.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - install from the .MSI file in Release folder

### Example Code
```বাংলা
পূর্ণ প্রধান ( ) {
    দেখাও( "Hello world" );
}
```

This code will output "Hello world" to the console.
